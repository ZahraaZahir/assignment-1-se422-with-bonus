Hi, this is a college project for a course named Parallel and Concurrent Programming (SE 422).

This assignment covers concepts of multithreaded programming and data sharing between threads.

I've used two design patterns which are Listener Design Pattern (Logger class) and Singleton Design Pattern (ThreadPoolProvider class) to manage code complexity and to try to create an elegant solution.
